# Projects

This repository consists of projects that I have done. The technologies used for these projects are Python and JMP. Below is a short description of all the projects and steps taken to analyze the datasets.

1. Revenue Projections - Using time series analytics, predicted accurately the revenue projections for a life sciences company for the year using historical data. Resources were allocated using findings from the projections.

2. Scraping & Analyzing www.Letgo.com Car Listings: Scraped data containing car listings using beautiful soup from www.letgo.com. Cleaned, prepared and organized the data. Uncovered Insights about the car listings and their properties based on KPI.

Clustered jobs titles based on the location. Identified and visualized underlying relationships between different factors such as job title, company,  skills and Salary.

3. Employee Exit Survey: Analyzing correlation between dissatisfaction and other decision variables to determine the sort of employees who are likely to resign due to dissatisfaction. Cleaned two datasets and Combined the TAFE & DETE datasets together to understand the underlying relationships between dissatisfied employees and their experience levels, age and their position.

Uncovering hidden relationships between brand/price, price of damaged cars vs non damaged cars, cars and the mileage they offer, Top 5 cars based on popularity and price.

5. Analyzing AirBnb Dataset using JMP: Predicted the log price of a house/room posted by a customer by clustering the data based on predictors like city, number of reviews, bed type. Based on the number of clusters obtained, selected a few clusters for prediction of the log price. On the selected clusters, used different supervised methods like regression equation, regression tree and neural networks to find the best method for prediction of price.

6. Visualize Earning Trends Between Different College Majors: The goal of this project is to analyze the earning trends between different majors. Visualize which majors are dominated by men and which ones are dominated by women. Also find out the median salaries for different majors.
